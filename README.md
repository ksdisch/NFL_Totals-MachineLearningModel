# NFL Over Under ML Model

Data was read into the provisional Machine Learning model using a jupyter notebook.\
Output labels were defined based on if the actual final score was higher than the Over Under Total (1 = Over, 0 = Under).\
Input data was preprocessed and fed into several Machine Learning Algorithms and compared based on their Accuracy Scores.
