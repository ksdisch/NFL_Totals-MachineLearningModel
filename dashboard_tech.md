## Tableau
Tableau is one of the most widely used data analysis and visualization tools in the world today. Tableau has become almost ubiquitous in today's professional world because it gives analysts the ability to create powerful analytic dashboards that tell a clear story and can be easily shared with others. Tableau is able to take any kind of data from nearly every system, and turn it into actionable insights with speed and ease.

## Interactive Element(s)
- The visualizations in the dashboard will have marker labels that pop-up when the user hovers over them. These markers give users deeper insight into individual data points.
- User selected data and/or filters: At least one visualization in the dashboard will include a drop down list of features for the user to choose from. The user's choice will either be the main data for the visualization, or a filter that alters the visualization.This will allow users to explore the data themself in a straightforward and digestible manner.
