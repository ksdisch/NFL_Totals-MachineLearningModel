## Tableau
Tableau is one of the most widely used data analysis and visualization tools in the world today. Tableau has become almost ubiquitous in today's professional world because it gives analysts the ability to create powerful analytic dashboards that tell a clear story and can be easily shared with others. Tableau is able to take any kind of data from nearly every system, and turn it into actionable insights with speed and ease.
