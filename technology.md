# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
For the initial exploration of the data, Excel will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Pandas.

## Database Storage
Considering AWS for the storage and Postgres for management.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create our classification model that will attempt to correctly classify NFL games into hitting the over or under on their game total (as determined by betting markets). We've been testing several algorithms and comparing their results as we continue to improve and refine the dataset and model.

## Dashboard
An interactive dashboard will be built using Tableau so that the data can be easily digested and explored.
